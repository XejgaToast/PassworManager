# PassworManager
A password generator and manager

NOTE: The passwords are really bad encrypted. I recommend to not share the "passwords.pm" with ANYONE, because it can get decrypted pretty easily (it's Caesar Encryption). I am working on a better encryption! :D

Right now, it is only availabe for Windows, but I'll work on a Python 3 version, so anyone can use it.
